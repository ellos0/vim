my little vim distribution

features:
  insert mode keybinds
  compilation of vim with extra stuff


to install, add executable permissions to build.sh ie:
chmod +x build.sh

then, run build.sh, add a install path if needed (default /usr/local)
./build.sh PATH

finally, source the main.vim program in your vimrc:
source ~/path/to/main.vim
